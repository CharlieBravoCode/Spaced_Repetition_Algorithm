To do for the Spaced_Repetition_Algorithm:

- build a list queue_cards
    - its a select statement of a sorted list by next review_date of the cards, pull from top.
    - from time to time the app also needs to pull new cards from the database

- build a function to get the next card
    - get the first card in the list queue_cards
    - if the list is empty, get the first card in the database

- build a function to update the card
- build a function to update the list queue_cards
